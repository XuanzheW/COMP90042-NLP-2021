    "\n",
    "**Instructions:** The length of the secret word is an important clue that we might exploit. Different lengths tend to have different distributions over characters, e.g., short words are less likely to have suffixes or prefixes. You should incorporate this idea by conditioning the unigram model on the length of the secret word, i.e.,  having a **different unigram model for each length**. You will need to be a little careful at test time, to be robust to the situation that you encounter a word length that you didn't see in training. In such a case, your method should behave like the previous `unigram_guesser` in Question 3 (i.e., it guesses characters based on unigram frequencies, unconditioned by the word length).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task**: Collect the frequencies of characters conditioned on the word length and store them in `unigram_counts_by_length` (use the first answer space). Complete the `unigram_length_guesser` method (use the second answer space).\n",

    "**Check**: Use the assertion statements in <b>\"For your testing\"</b> below for the expected output."

    "**Instructions:** Now for the next challenge, you'll build a **bigram language model** over characters. The order of characters is obviously important, yet this wasn't incorporated in any of the above models. Knowing that the word has the sequence `n _ s s` is a pretty strong clue that the missing character might be `e`. Similarly the distribution over characters that start or end a word are highly biased (e.g., toward common prefixes and suffixes, like *un-*, *-ed* and *-ly*).\n",
    "\n",
    "The task here is to develop a bigram language model over characters, and train it over the training words. Remember to be careful when handling the start of each word properly, e.g., by padding with a special starting symbol such as `$`. Do we also need a special ending symbol? That's for you to decide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your bigram guesser should apply your language model to each blank position in the secret word by using its left context character. For example, in the partial word `e _ c _ b _ _` we know the left context for the first three blanks, but have no known left context for the last blank. In the case for the last blank, you should revert to using a unigram language model (since there's no context for us to use the bigram model). You should sum up the probability distribution (over all alphabets from <i>a</i> to <i>z</i>) for the 4 blanks, and select the alphabet with the highest probability that hasn't been guessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task**: Collect frequency counts that are necessary for building a bigram language model and store them in bigram_counts; feel free to add new objects if needed (use the first answer space).

    "From question 2 to 5, I found that taking ngram language model has better performance, and with n growing up, it seems that the 'Average number of incorrect guesses' is smaller and smaller. So in question 6, I tried trigram model, finding the answer is around 8.0, not stable, then there are two choices: \n",
    "1. use a higher ngram model, like quadgram model.\n",
    "2. import bidirection method\n",
    "Through research I found quadgram may have serious data sparsity, and need larger corpus training, I finally choose mothed 2. I think sometime inverse language model can give more information, like 'on' to predict $'i'$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my approach, I still add the probabilities of all $'\\_'$ for each character 'a-z', and return the maxmium as the question 5 did. But what's a little different is that I give a weight to each model, like 0.9 for the bigram, 0.3 for the unigram, which is because trigram contains more information than bigram and unigram, these two models may give some noise to the probability. \n",
    "At the end, my model stays stable at about 7.4.\n",
